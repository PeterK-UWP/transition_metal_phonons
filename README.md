# Get ecut vs energy and past through plot_convergence to get the cutoff energy
# ecut 150: -118.69722486 Ry
# ecut 160: -118.69704777 Ry
# Pass the volume_totalenergy file through run.script

# Create atom energies and atom numbers dictionary 

We need to write a function to parse the filename for the crystal phase, identify the atoms needed and how many atoms of
each are needed

# Pass atom energies, atom numbers, and equilibirium energy of the phase to the cohesive energy function

# Store the returned cohesive energy in the values dictionary
